I'm really sad, because I just deleted the original README file I've wrote
like, 7 months ago, and I don't remember the links that were here, anyway, I
was in the middle of reading that file when I deleted it by mistake, and the
original file suggested you to probably do a symbolic link to the file above to
somewhere zsh can read it, I don't remember where, I hope the links above can
help you in anyway, sincerely a Hoyer from the past.
